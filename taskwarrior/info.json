  "description" : "This script creates menu items and buttons to import and export Taskwarrior tasks.\n\n<b>Dependencies</b>\n\nUnix-like OSes only!\n<a href=\"http://taskwarrior.org\">Taskwarrior</a>\n\n<b>Usage</b>\n\n<i>Export:</i>\nThe script takes selected text from your note and parse it to create task entries based on it. The following rules currently apply for the test to be parsed correctly:\n * the project is defined by writing \"project:\" (case-insensitive) immediately followed by the project name; the rest of the line content is skipped\n * the headers (lines starting with #) are also considered as project names - no nesting available yet\n * the task is defined by making a list item, using either - (minus) or * (asterisk) at the beginning; the task description taken will be used with the most recently detected project name to create a new task\n\n<i>Import:</i>\nThe script takes selected text from your note, parsing it into the project names you want to fetch from Taskwarrior into the note. The tasks will be written as a list right below the selection. The project names will be appended before the lists As \"Project: [projectName]\" to separate lists.<b>To Do</b>\n\n * foolproof used regexps\n * make project nesting easier\n * Windows support\n * Taskwarrior parameter parsing (like tags, dates, priority, etc.)"
