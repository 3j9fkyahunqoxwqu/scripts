# QOwnNotes script repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qownnotes/scripts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qownnotes/scripts)

Here you will find the scripts you can directly access in [QOwnNotes](http://www.qownnotes.org), plain-text file notepad with markdown support and Nextcloud and ownCloud integration.

Please visit the [Scripting documentation](http://docs.qownnotes.org/en/develop/scripting/README.html) for more information about scripting and how to write your own.

To bring your script into the **script repository** you just have to do the following:

- **[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)** this repository
- **duplicate** the **`example-script` folder** and give it an other name
- **add your script** to the folder and remove the `example-script.qml`
- **edit** the **`info.json`** to add your meta data
  - you can use [example script info.json](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fqownnotes%2Fscripts%2Fmaster%2Fexample-script%2Finfo.json) to help you with the json encoding
- **commit and push** your changes to your repository
- create a **[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)** to get your script merged into the QOwnNotes script repository
